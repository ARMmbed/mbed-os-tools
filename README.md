# Mbed OS tools

This repository contains the Python modules needed to work with Mbed OS.
Historically, the Mbed OS tools have been delivered in separate packages and
repositories. Their APIs have evolved separately over time, each with their own
style and syntax. This project unifies these packages into a single intuitive
API.
